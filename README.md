## Project Details
For this project, I aim to understand why Bayesian Networks are not as utilized in Image Classification as they are in other fields of study, such as information retrieval and filtering.

This project was made for the "Aprendizagem Automática Avançada" class, from FCUL, using Python.

Made by: Diogo Araújo - 60997

## Project Summary
Current implementations of deep learning for the field of Image Classification stray away from probabilistic models such as Bayesian Networks. This raises the questions as to why that is, which is what I attempt to figure out with this project.

In order to achieve this, I will be conducting / creating a Bayesian Network model with the purpose of image classification on three different data sets. I will then compare its results with a more popular model currently being used for Image Classification, which will be the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This model is commonly used for image recognition and processing due to its ability to recognise patterns in images.

With this comparison, I aim to better understand why the Bayesian model is less popular than the CNN model and, by default, other Image Classification models. This will be approached from various angles, such as the results obtained, their real world application, the effect of the data quality and time that they took, as a way of analysing their differences in detail.

## Datasets Used

For this project, I used three different data sets:

- Low Quality Data set - MNIST.
  
- Medium Quality Data set - Fashion-MNIST.
  
- High Quality Data set - CIFAR-10.
